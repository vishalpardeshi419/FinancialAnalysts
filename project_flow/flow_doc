Summary of Flow: ðŸ’¡

User Registration: User provides credentials (username, password, role) â†’ Server hashes password â†’ New user is created â†’ Success response with user info.

User Login: User provides username and password â†’ Server checks credentials â†’ JWT token is generated â†’ Success response with the token.

GraphQL Access: Users can log in/register via GraphQL queries/mutations, receiving a JWT token.

Authorization: For protected routes, the user must send the JWT token in the Authorization header. Middleware checks the token's validity and the user's role for access control.

Database Sync: Upon server startup, Sequelize synchronizes the database schema.
This setup ensures secure user authentication and role-based authorization, allowing different access levels for different user roles like "Admin" and "Finance".
